This section will introduce you to GovnoCore 32 architecture.
Specifically this manual is about the Govno Core 32-20020 Gen 1 Tiger CPU,
the newest GovnoCore CPU by the time of 25-06-22

It will cover it's registers, memory layout and binary structure.

GovnoCore 32-20020 instructions follow 1 of 2 formats
  <opc:8> <imm:8> | 2 bytes
  or
  <opc:8> <imm:8> <imm:32> | 4 bytes
The opcode is always 8 bits, storing a value from 0 to 255.
The 8-bit immediate often stores the destination register, or
a register cluster.
A register cluster is an 8-bit value that stores 2 4-bit
register addresses, which can store addresses from eax to e15.
Specifically to access registers e16-e31 using the register
cluster, an rswp:$F0 instruction was added. The rswp:$F0
instruction swaps the first 16 registers with the second 16
registers. Specifically for ESP and EBP not breaking with
rswp:$F0 instruction, the e22-e23 registers are also initialized
to default stack pointer value: $00FEFFFF.
